public class NextGreaterElement {
//    Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array),
//    print the Next Greater Number for every element.
//    The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array,
//    which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number.
//    If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
//
//    Example 1:
//    Input: [1,2,1]
//    Output: [2,-1,2]
