//Given an m x n 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
//
//An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: grid = [
//  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
//  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
//  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
//]
//Output: 1
